# COMP 4490 Project

**Author:** Christian Melendez

**OS:** Windows 10

**Graphics hardware:** Nvidia GEForce GTX 960M + Intel HD Graphics 530

- Used Visual Studio 2017
- See src folder for cpp and glsl files

## Description
Using FABRIK technique to approach inverse kinematics problems

## Instructions
- Clone, open and run with Visual Studio 2017.
- There are two modes a single arm and a running robot, change the mode with 't'
- To move the goal position, use the number keys (8 and 2 for y-axis, 4 and 6 for x-axis and 7 and 3 for z-axis)
- As you can see, the robot implementation is not completed yet because needing to deal more to make a it more natural like managing goal position in between of steps, and also adding the limits of angle of rotation
